Add some notices of Pro plugins in the lite plugins. 

To add this feature to the plugin, you can follow the below steps:

1. Copy the ts-pro-notices.php file into your plugin folder.

2. Include the file once when on the admin page. This can be done with is_admin() function. 

3. You need to pass the 3 parameters to the default constructor of the ts_pro_notices class. You need to change the value of the variable as per the respective plugin.

    $wcap_plugin_prefix      = 'wcap';
    $wcap_plugin_name        = 'Abandoned Cart Pro for WooCommerce';
    $wcap_lite_plugin_prefix = 'wcal';

    new ts_pro_notices( $wcap_plugin_name, $wcap_lite_plugin_prefix, $wcap_plugin_prefix );

4. You need to add one do_action in your lite plguin. This do_action will be placed under the "register_activation_hook" hook of the plguin.

The do_action will be like {{plugin-prefix}}_activate

For an ex:

do_action( 'wcal_activate' );

Here, 'wcal' is tge prefix of the AC Lite. 

5. Then you need create an array of the notices.
 
 $ts_pro_notices = array (
                1 => $message_first,
                2 => $message_two,
                3 => $message_three,
                4 => $message_four,
                5 => $message_five,
                6 => $message_six,
                7 => $message_seven,
                8 => $message_eight,
                9 => $message_nine,
            ) ;

Here, you dont need to change the index, you just need to change the message variable.
